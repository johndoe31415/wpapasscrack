# wpapasscrack
This is a very simple wrapper script for John the Ripper / aircrack-ng to
attempt to crack multiple WPA networks at once using dictionary attacks. Simple
dictionaries are prefered first in order to quickly determine weak networks. Be
aware that this is a white hat pentesting tool and using it to break other
people's networks is likely illegal.
